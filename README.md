# Movie Madness

## Goal:
Our goal for this project was to create a one-stop application that would allow its users to find all information that they could want about a movie. Whether it be through searching a specific movie or genre they will get a list of top matches to look through and choose. From there they will be sent to a new page that shows them all the information they could need.
